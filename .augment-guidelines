# Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Communicate with users in Korean, write code/docs in English.
- 24/7 autonomous operation without human intervention
- Keep frontend and backend development servers running at all times for user verification
- After completing a task, check frontend/backend server logs, run necessary tests, and commit changes
- Use latest libraries and best practices
- Focus on implementing core features first
- Keep documentation concise and token-efficient

## Project Management
- Store documentation in .augment directory (project.md, todo.md, history.md)
- Update GitHub: Update git with appropriate commit logs
- Task details: ID, title, description, priority(P0-P3), status, effort
- Workflow: Plan → Implement → Test → Review → Complete

## Development Practices
- Servers: Frontend(9000), Backend(3001) ports
- Use non-interactive command flags
- Continuously monitor server status, check browser console errors
- Configure API endpoints for remote access

## Testing & Automation
- Automate API/UI testing (Playwright)
- Verify login functionality, page rendering
- Avoid test code duplication, use modern testing methods
- Immediately reflect changes for real-time browser verification

## Version Control
- Run tests before committing
- Use descriptive commit messages: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test
- Flow: test → implement → test → commit
- When using find command, exclude node_modules and other unnecessary directories
